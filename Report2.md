# Team Contributions Report 2

- **Kadin**: I reviewed all of the pull requests and had them make appropriate edits. After the pull requests were correct I merged all of our updates into the main branch.
- **Luke**: Updated all of the git history to ensure that none of the sensitive information was able to be accessed. This also ensured that future exposure would be prevented.
- **Madhav**: I worked on  the CI/CD pipeline on a seperate branch and created a pull request to have it merged to main. 
- **Surya**: I worked on Step 1. First I created a new branch from the most recent version of main and renamed the files player.py and test_player.py to pacman.py and test_pacman.py, respectively, using the mv command. Then, using grep and sed, I renamed all references in the .py files of "player" to "pacman" and "Player" to "Pacman." I also renamed an old branch called feature/player to feature/pacman by renaming it locally then pushing the new version to remote and deleting the old one.
